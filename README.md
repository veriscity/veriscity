### Pok√©mon RadioGold
A tentatively titled Pok√©mon HeartGold ROM hack built using HG-Engine. As my first foray into ROM hacking, I'm anticipating a long, error-filled process that will also hopefully be a valuable learning experience. Eventually, I plan on developing a ROM hack set in a custom region, featuring new characters and an original story that I've been working on for a decade.  

Pok√©mon RadioGold is intended to be a Vanilla++ experience with a focus on enhancing the base game rather than completely altering it. All 493 Pok√©mon will be available, Pok√©mon will be modified to have new stats, abilities, and types, battles will be slightly more challenging, the shiny rate will be increased, and many quality-of-life features will be implemented.

Key features of this hack will include revamped and expanded maps, new locations, and a reworked story. Towns, cities, and routes will be updated wih new buildings, decorations, and NPCs to make them feel more interesting and unique. Other locations will be reworked entirely, such as Mr. Pok√©mon's house being replaced by a version of Sinnoh's Pok√©mon Mansion. The story will roughly follow the original plot, but dialogue and events will be adjusted to expand the role of radio and to connect some of the more disparate story threads. 

Since I'm completely new to ROM hacking, some of these planned features will likely change as I learn more about the process and develop a more cohesive idea of what I'm trying to do.
